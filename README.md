# Compatibility

This module is supposed to work with all registries using the CoCCA platform.

# WHMCS Module Installation instructions

1. Download and install [WHMCS](https://whmcs.com/)

2. Place the repository as **cocca** directory in `[WHMCS]/modules/registrars`, place your key.pem and cert.pem files in the same cocca directory.

3. Activate from Configuration -> Apps & Integrations -> (search for cocca) -> Activate

4. Configure from Configuration -> System Settings -> Domain Registrars

5. Add a new TLD using Configuration -> System Settings -> Domain Pricing

6. Create a **whois.json** file in `[WHMCS]/resources/domains` and add the following:

```
[
    {
        "extensions": ".yourtld",
        "uri": "socket://your.whois.url",
        "available": "NOT FOUND"
    }
]
```

You should be good to go now.

# Troubleshooting

## Fixing "Oops!" Issues in WHMCS

If you experience "Oops!" or blank page errors in WHMCS after activating the CoCCA EPP module, it might be caused by incorrect file permissions or ownership. Follow these steps to fix it:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/whmcs/modules/registrars/cocca
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/whmcs/modules/registrars/cocca
```

Replace `/var/www/html/whmcs` with the path to your WHMCS installation, if different.

## Generating an SSL Certificate and Key

If you do not have an SSL certificate and private key for secure communication with the registry, you can generate one using OpenSSL.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

**Note:** For production environments, it's recommended to use a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) instead of a self-signed certificate.

## Need More Help?

If the steps above donâ€™t resolve your issue, refer to the WHMCS logs (`/path/to/whmcs/logs`) or enable `Display Errors` in the WHMCS Admin under `Utilities > System > General Settings > Other` to identify the specific problem.
